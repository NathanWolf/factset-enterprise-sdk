## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Attributes** | **List&lt;string&gt;** | List of attributes to be searched in. The value &#x60;allEntitled&#x60; cannot appear with any other value. | [optional] 
**Value** | **string** | Full-text search string. It may be enclosed in double quotes (\&quot;). No escaping is provided, therefore it is impossible to specify a search string containing double quotes. Relevance of word starts is indicated by a phrase starting with a space character, such as \&quot; daimler\&quot;. If only two characters are submitted, the search is executed as an exact search. |
