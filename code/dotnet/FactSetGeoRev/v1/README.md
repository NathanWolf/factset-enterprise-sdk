# FactSet.SDK.FactSetGeoRev - the C# library for the FactSet GeoRev API

FactSet Revere Geographic Revenue (\"GeoRev\") Exposure data provides a highly structured and normalized display of companies’ revenues by geography. Using a four level taxonomy structure, understand the companies' Super-Region- ->Region- ->Area- ->Country revenue breakdowns. Quickly understand a company’s revenue exposure in countries impacted by geopolitical, macroeconomic, and market risk. Understand the geographic footprint of a company based on sources of revenue versus country of domicile, and analyze global revenue exposures at the company, index, or portfolio level.<p> Geographic revenue has historically been difficult to analyze due to companies’ non-standard and incomplete reporting. Investors relying solely on this as-reported data are limited in their ability to compare, aggregate or screen exposures across a universe or portfolio of companies. To achieve normalization, FactSet GeoRev captures data through a proprietary four-level geographic classification structure. An estimation algorithm based on GDP weighting and accounting logic is then applied to solve for any non-explicit disclosures. The result is a consistent, accurate, and flexible dataset that can take a company’s revenues and break them down into any geographic country or region categories.</p><p>As markets become more integrated and companies expand operations beyond their domestic markets, GeoRev provides a new and valuable country factor to help investors discover alpha, model risk exposure, optimize portfolio weighting, and improve fund administration and reporting.</p><p>Data Frequency -  Annual; Update Frequency - Daily. 49,000+ Publically Listed Companies. All Russell 3000 and MSCI ACWI Index Consituents. U.S. Data is available from 2003, with Non-US data from 2007. For more details, visit [OA 17555](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/17555)</p>

- API version: 1.0.1
- SDK version: 0.9.0
- Build package: com.factset.sdk.codegen.FactsetCsharpNetcoreCodegen

<a name="frameworks-supported"></a>
## Frameworks supported
- .NET Core >=1.0
- .NET Framework >=4.6
- Mono/Xamarin >=vNext

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies

- [RestSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp) - 106.11.7 or later
- [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) - 12.0.3 or later
- [JsonSubTypes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JsonSubTypes/) - 1.8.0 or later
- [System.ComponentModel.Annotations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.ComponentModel.Annotations) - 5.0.0 or later

The DLLs included in the package may not be the latest version. We recommend using [NuGet](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget) to obtain the latest version of the packages:
```
Install-Package RestSharp
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
Install-Package JsonSubTypes
Install-Package System.ComponentModel.Annotations
```

NOTE: RestSharp versions greater than 105.1.0 have a bug which causes file uploads to fail. See [RestSharp#742](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/742).
NOTE: RestSharp for .Net Core creates a new socket for each api call, which can lead to a socket exhaustion problem. See [RestSharp#1406](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/1406).

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation
Generate the DLL using your preferred tool (e.g. `dotnet build`)

Then include the DLL (under the `bin` folder) in the C# project, and use the namespaces:
```csharp
using FactSet.SDK.FactSetGeoRev.Api;
using FactSet.SDK.FactSetGeoRev.Client;
using FactSet.SDK.FactSetGeoRev.Model;
```
<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

To use the API client with a HTTP proxy, setup a `System.Net.WebProxy`
```csharp
Configuration c = new Configuration();
System.Net.WebProxy webProxy = new System.Net.WebProxy("http://myProxyUrl:80/");
webProxy.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
c.Proxy = webProxy;
```
