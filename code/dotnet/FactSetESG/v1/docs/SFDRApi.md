Gets Principle Adverse Impact (PAI) data to support compliant SFDR Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) reporting

SFDR Principle Adverse Impact (PAI) data is built specifically to support compliant Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) reporting. FactSet collects PAI data items from publicly available company-reported information and FactSet databases, such as FactSet Fundamentals, FactSet RBICS with Revenue and FactSet People, which are also based on company-disclosures. FactSet uses Truvalue Labs SASB Spotlights for supplemental OECD & UNGC violation checks where company reporting is sparse.
