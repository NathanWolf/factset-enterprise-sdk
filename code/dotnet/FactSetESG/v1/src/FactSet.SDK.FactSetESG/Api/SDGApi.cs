 * FactSet ESG API
 *
 * FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 13 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs, industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company&#39;s SDG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.| |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization | |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company SDG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for &#x60;IMPACT&#x60; category)**. &lt;p&gt;**Adjusted Insight Score &#x3D; (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.&lt;/p&gt;| |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for &#x60;IMPACT&#x60; category).**| |**TTM_VOLUME**|*TTM Volume*, measures the data flow over a trailing twelve month period.| |**SDG_RANK**|*SDG Rank*, offers rank leveraging the 16 ESG categories defined by Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).The datatype for the data returned when this score types is requested is String**(ONLY Vaild for &#x60;IMPACT&#x60; category)**.|  (optional)</param>

The cognitive computing system behind FactSet&#39;s Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.&lt;/p&gt;  ### SDG Score Types  |**SDG Category Input**|**Description**| |- --|- --| |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.| |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company&#39;s longer-term SDG track record, similar to a ratings system.
