# FactSet.SDK.FactSetPrices.Model.RollingPeriod
Period of measure for the rolling cumulative return. This does not change display `frequency` but rather the underlying return calculation period. All periods are referencing actual periods of measure, not period-ends. For example, 1M rolling period will go back to that date the previous month, which is not always the month-end date.
