/*
 * Funds API For Digital Portals
 *
 * Search for mutual funds and ETFs using one single consolidated API, including a criteria-based screener. The API provides also base data, key figures, and holdings.  A separate endpoint returns the possible values and value range for the parameters that the endpoint /fund/notation/screener/search accepts: Application developers can request the values and value range only for a restricted set of notations that match predefined parameters. This functionality may be used to pre-fill the values and value ranges of the parameters of the /fund/notation/screener/search endpoint so that performing a search always leads to a non-empty set of notations.  This API is fully integrated with the corresponding Quotes API, allowing access to detailed price and performance information of instruments, as well as basic security identifier cross-reference. For direct access to price histories, please refer to the Time Series API for Digital Portals.  Similar criteria based screener APIs exist for equity instruments and securitized derivatives: See the Stocks API and the Securitized Derivatives API for details.
