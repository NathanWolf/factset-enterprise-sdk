/*
 * Stocks API For Digital Portals
 *
 * The Stocks API features a screener to search for equity instruments based on stock-specific parameters.  Parameters for up to three fiscal years might now be used in one request; data is available for the ten most recent completed fiscal years. Estimates are available for the current and two consecutive fiscal years. Search criteria also include benchmark-related attributes (beta, correlation, outperformance), and ESG parameters, based on FactSetâ€™s Truvalue ESG scores.  A separate endpoint returns the possible values and value ranges for the parameters that the endpoint /stock/notation/screener/search accepts Application developers can request the values and value ranges only for a restricted set of notations that match predefined parameters. This functionality may be used to pre-fill the values and value ranges of the parameters of the /stock/notation/screener/search endpoint so that performing a search always leads to a non-empty set of notations.  The endpoint /stock/notation/ranking/intraday/list ranks stocks notations using intraday figures, for example to build a gainers/losers list.   Additional endpoints include end-of-day benchmark key figures, and selected fundamentals (as of end of fiscal year and with daily updates).  This API is fully integrated with the corresponding [Quotes API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/quotes-api-digital-portals), allowing access to detailed price and performance information of instruments, as well as basic security identifier cross-reference. For direct access to price histories, please refer to the [Time Series API for Digital Portals](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/time-series-api-digital-portals).  Similar criteria based screener APIs exist for fixed income instruments and securitized derivatives: See the [Bonds API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/bonds-api-digital-portals) and the [Securitized Derivatives API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/securitized-derivatives-api-digital-portals) for details.
