# FactSet.SDK.SecuritizedDerivativesAPIforDigitalPortals.Model.InlineResponse2007DataSingleParticipationFactor
Participation factor of the securitized derivative in the performance of the underlying, depending on the exercise right (see attribute `exercise.right` in endpoint `/securitizedDerivative/get`).

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Positive** | **decimal** | Participation factor above the barrier for a securitized derivative with exercise right call, and below the barrier for exercise right put.  | [optional] 
**Negative** | **decimal** | Participation factor above the barrier for a securitized derivative with exercise right put, and below the barrier for exercise right call. | [optional]
