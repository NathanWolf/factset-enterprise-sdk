# FactSet.SDK.ETFProfileandPrices.Model.InlineResponse20022Data
Fund flows (i.e., the amount invested or divested from a fund) based on the creation/redemption process. The data returned may not be related to overall volume or price movement. All fund flow inputs use transaction-day values to ensure that all assets under management (AUM) and flows are fully comparable and reflective of the same, verified market conditions.
