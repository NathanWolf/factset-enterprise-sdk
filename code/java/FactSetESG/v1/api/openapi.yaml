    FactSet ESG (powered by FactSet Truvalue Labs) applies machine learning to uncover risks and opportunities from companies' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) behavior, which are aggregated and categorized into continuously updated, material ESG scores. The service focuses on company ESG behavior from external sources and includes both positive and negative events that go beyond traditional sources of ESG risk data.<p> FactSet ESG extracts, analyzes, and generates scores from millions of documents each month collected from more than 100,000 data sources in over 30 languages. Sources include news, trade journals, NGOs, watchdog groups, trade blogs, industry reports and social media. Products deliver investable insights by revealing value and risk factors from unstructured data at the speed of current events.</p>

          The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
          <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

          ### ESG Score Types

          |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
          |---|---|
          |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
          |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
          |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
          |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
          |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
          |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
          |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
          |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

          \ addresses issues associated with environmental and social externalities\
          \ created by suppliers through their operational activities. Such issues\
          \ include, but are not limited to, environmental responsibility, human rights,\
          \ labor practices, and ethics and corruption. Management may involve screening,\
          \ selection, monitoring, and engagement with suppliers on their environmental\
          \ and social impacts. The category does not address the impacts of external\
          \ factors – such as climate change and other environmental and social factors\
          \ – on suppliers' operations and/or on the availability and pricing of key\
          \ resources, which is covered in a separate category.|\n|**SYSTEMICRISKMGT**|**Systemic\
          \ Risk Management** - the category addresses the company's contributions\
          \ to, or management of systemic risks resulting from large-scale weakening\
          \ or collapse of systems upon which the economy and society depend. This\
          \ includes financial systems, natural resource systems, and technological\
          \ systems. It addresses the mechanisms a company has in place to reduce\
          \ its contributions to systemic risks and to improve safeguards that may\
          \ mitigate the impacts of systemic failure. For financial institutions,\
          \ the category also captures the company's ability to absorb shocks arising\
          \ from financial and economic stress and meet stricter regulatory requirements\
          \ related to the complexity and interconnectedness of companies in the industry.|\n\
          |**WASTEANDHZRDMATSMGT**|**Waste and Hazardous Materials Management** -\
          \ the category addresses environmental issues associated with hazardous\
          \ and non-hazardous waste generated by companies. It addresses a company's\
          \ management of solid wastes in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industrial\
          \ processes. It covers treatment, handling, storage, disposal, and regulatory\
          \ compliance. The category does not cover emissions to air or wastewater,\
          \ nor does it cover waste from end-of-life of products, which are addressed\
          \ in separate categories.|\n|**WATERANDWASTEWATERMGT**|**Water and Wastewater\
          \ Management** - the category addresses a company's water use, water consumption,\
          \ wastewater generation, and other impacts of operations on water resources,\
          \ which may be influenced by regional differences in the availability and\
          \ quality of and competition for water resources. More specifically, it\
          \ addresses management strategies including, but not limited to, water efficiency,\

          <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

          ### ESG Score Types

          |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
          |---|---|
          |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
          |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company’s longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event’s influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
          |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company’s ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
          |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
          |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
          |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
          |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
          |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

          ### Helper Input
          **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the "scoreTypes" listed above in a simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to explitly request each scoreType in the list.

When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
          <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

          ### SDG Score Types

          |**SDG Category Input**|**Description**|
          |---|---|
          |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
          |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term SDG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
          |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's SDG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
          |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization |
          |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company SDG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category)**. <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
          |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category).**|
          |**TTM_VOLUME**|*TTM Volume*, measures the data flow over a trailing twelve month period.|
          |**SDG_RANK**|*SDG Rank*, offers rank leveraging the 16 ESG categories defined by Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).The datatype for the data returned when this score types is requested is String**(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category)**.|

          \ interests may have the potential for long-term adverse direct or indirect\
          \ environmental and social impacts. The category addresses a company's level\
          \ of reliance upon regulatory policy or monetary incentives (such as subsidies\
          \ and taxes), actions to influence industry policy (such as through lobbying),\
          \ overall reliance on a favorable regulatory environment for business competitiveness,\
          \ and ability to comply with relevant regulations. It may relate to the\
          \ alignment of management and investor views of regulatory engagement and\

          \ availability and pricing of key resources. It addresses a company's ability\
          \ to manage these risks through product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life\
          \ management, such as by using of recycled and renewable materials, reducing\
          \ the use of key materials (dematerialization), maximizing resource efficiency\
          \ in manufacturing, and making R&D investments in substitute materials.\
          \ Additionally, companies can manage these issues by screening, selection,\
          \ monitoring, and engagement with suppliers to ensure their resilience to\
          \ external risks. It does not address issues associated with environmental\

          \ of extreme weather, shifting climate, sea level risk, and other expected\
          \ physical impacts of climate change. Management may involve enhancing resiliency\
          \ of physical assets and/or surrounding infrastructure as well as incorporation\
          \ of climate change-related considerations into key business activities\
          \ (e.g., mortgage and insurance underwriting, planning and development of\
          \ real estate projects).|\n|**PDANDLIFECYCLEMGT**|**Product Design and Lifecycle\
          \ Management** - the category addresses incorporation of environmental,\
          \ social, and governance (ESG) considerations in characteristics of products\
          \ and services provided or sold by the company. It includes, but is not\
          \ limited to, managing the lifecycle impacts of products and services, such\
          \ as those related to packaging, distribution, use-phase resource intensity,\
          \ and other environmental and social externalities that may occur during\
          \ their use-phase or at the end of life. The category captures a company's\
          \ ability to address customer and societal demand for more sustainable products\
          \ and services as well as to meet evolving environmental and social regulation.\
          \ It does not address direct environmental or social impacts of the company's\
          \ operations nor does it address health and safety risks to consumers from\
          \ product use, which are covered in other categories.|\n|**PRODQUALITYANDSFTY**|**Product\
          \ Quality and Safety** - the category addresses issues involving unintended\

          \ ethical and responsible marketing practices, misleading or deceptive labeling,\
          \ as well as discriminatory or predatory selling and lending practices.\
          \ This may include deceptive or aggressive selling practices in which incentive\
          \ structures for employees could encourage the sale of products or services\
          \ that are not in the best interest of customers or clients.|\n|**SUPPLYCHAINMGT**|**Supply\
          \ Chain Management** - the category addresses management of environmental,\
          \ social, and governance (ESG) risks within a company's supply chain. It\
          \ addresses issues associated with environmental and social externalities\
          \ created by suppliers through their operational activities. Such issues\
          \ include, but are not limited to, environmental responsibility, human rights,\

Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
        <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

        ### SDG Score Types

        |**SDG Category Input**|**Description**|
        |---|---|
        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term SDG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
        |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's SDG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
        |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization |
        |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company SDG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category)**. <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
        |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category).**|
        |**TTM_VOLUME**|*TTM Volume*, measures the data flow over a trailing twelve month period.|
        |**SDG_RANK**|*SDG Rank*, offers rank leveraging the 16 ESG categories defined by Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).The datatype for the data returned when this score types is requested is String**(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category)**.|

            ### ESG Score Types

            |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
            |---|---|
            |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
            |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
            |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
            |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
            |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
            |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
            |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
            |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
            <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

            ### ESG Score Types

            |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
            |---|---|
            |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
            |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
            |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique ESG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
            |**ART_VOL_TTM**|*Article Volume Score*, measures the information flow or number of articles about a company over the past 12 months.|
            |**CAT_VOL_TTM**|*Category Volume Score*, returns the total number of times any of the 26 categories received a score over a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period of time.|
            |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization **(NOT VALID for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` category types).**|
            |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories). <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
            |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `ALLCATEGORIES` and `MATERIALITY` categories).**|

            ### Helper Input
            **ALL**= *Ability to fetch all of the "scoreTypes" listed above in a simplified query.* This is used by default and removes the need to explitly request each scoreType in the list.

            |**SDG Category Input**|**Description**|
            |---|---|
            |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
            |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term SDG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
            |**MOMENTUM**|*Momentum Score*, measures the trend of a company's Insight score. It is a unique SDG metric in the industry that gives investors a high-precision view of the trajectory of a company's ESG performance, relative to peers. It does so by precisely articulating upward or downward movement, relative to that of all others in the universe, making it a measure that enhances quantitative workflows.|
            |**DYNAMIC_MAT**|*Dynamic Materiality Score*, shows the percentage value of data flow by category compared with the total data flow for the organization |
            |**ADJ_INSIGHT**|*Adjusted Insight*, Measures company ESG performance, generating scores for lower-volume and zero-volume firms by blending company scores with industry medians. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category)**. <p>**Adjusted Insight Score = (# of articles / 5) x Company Insight Score + ((5 - # of articles) / 5) x Industry (or Sector) Median Insight Score.</p>|
            |**IND_PCTL**|*Industry Percentile*, offers context on company Adjusted Insight scores relative to peers in the same SICS Industry. This value is used to establish the textual ESG Rank. **(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category).**|
            |**TTM_VOLUME**|*TTM Volume*, measures the data flow over a trailing twelve month period.|
            |**SDG_RANK**|*SDG Rank*, offers rank leveraging the 16 ESG categories defined by Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).**(ONLY Vaild for `IMPACT` category)**The datatype for the data returned when this score types is requested is String.|

        The FactSet Truvalue Score types being requested. Score Types include the Pulse, Insight, Momentum, Article Volume, Category Volume, Dynamic Materiality Score, Adjusted Insight, and Industry Percentile. When left blank all score types will be returned for the requested Id. To specify select scores returned in the response, provide a comma-separated list of the scores using the description below.
        <p>These scores use the same underlying data and 100-point scale, except for ranks and percentiles. The cognitive computing system behind FactSet's Truvalue Platform uses natural language processing to interpret semantic content and generate analytics. It does so by applying criteria that are consistent with established sustainability and ESG frameworks, scoring data points on performance using a 0 to 100 scale. A score of 50 represents a neutral impact. Scores above 50 indicate positive performance, and scores below reflect negative performance.</p>

        ### ESG Score Types

        |**SASB Category Input**|**Description**|
        |---|---|
        |**PULSE**|*Pulse Score*, is a measure of near-term performance changes that highlights opportunities and controversies, enabling real-time monitoring of companies. It focuses on events of the day and provides a responsive signal to alert investors to dynamic moves.|
        |**INSIGHT**|*Insight Score*, a measure of a company's longer-term ESG track record, similar to a ratings system. Scores are less sensitive to daily events and reflect the enduring performance record of a company over time. Scores are derived using an exponentially-weighted moving average of the Pulse, defined below, and the half-life of an event's influence on the overall score is 6 months.|
