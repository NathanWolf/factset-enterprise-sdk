        This endpoint extracts themes from unstructured text. Each theme (`themeText`) is also given a score (`themeScore`). This score shows the relevancy of the theme within the text.
        Example Output:
        ```json
        {
          "data": [
          {
            "themeText": "home entertainment results",
            "themeScore": 0.92
          },
          {
            "themeText": ".....",
            "themeScore": .....

          Power and Control System Friday, December 11, 2020 01:00:00 PM (GMT)Innovative
          technology breaks down barriers to indoor, vertical and greenhouse farming
          by reducing power consumption, cutting costs and increasing crop yield Advanced
          Energy (Nasdaq: AEIS) – a global leader in highly engineered, precision
          power conversion, measurement, and control solutions – today unveiled its
          newest lighting and power control system for indoor, vertical and greenhouse
          farming. This press release features multimedia. Advanced Energy''s new
          Artesyn iTS provides the industry''s first solution for switching or sharing
          a single power source between two different rooms. This reduces installation
          costs by cutting the number of iHP power supplies needed in half and it
          substantially reduces ongoing utility costs. (Photo: Business Wire)AE''s
          new lighting and power system transforms the use of LED technology in horticultural
          lighting systems, which plays a fundamental role in cutting-edge farming
          practices that can address production challenges in food, pharmaceutical
          ingredients, plants and flowers. Utilizing AE''s system, customers reduce
          their power conversion costs by as much as 50 percent, significantly lower
          installation and operating costs, and increase the quality of crop yield.
          "Our groundbreaking lighting, power and control system delivers significant
          improvements over conventional lighting solutions and opens up new opportunities
          for the industry," said Joe Voyles, vice president, industrial marketing,
          at Advanced Energy. "We are transforming our customers'' operations by both
          reducing the amount of needed equipment and improving the efficiency of
          the lighting systems, thereby reducing cost and energy spend. Not only do
          these innovative new products increase the efficiency and quality of fruit
          and vegetable production, but they also open the door to establishing indoor
          farming facilities in harsh environments anywhere in the world." The new
          system consists of the patented Artesyn iTS (intelligent Transfer Switch)
          and iHPS configurable power supply. Alongside Artesyn''s compact new 12
          kW 300 VDC module, AE delivers a cost-effective platform for the most advanced
          indoor farming applications. The system is estimated to produce a 38 percent
          savings to lighting power and control installation cost, while eliminating
          substantial amounts of wasted energy. The new iHPS is a "short" version
          of AE''s market-leading iHP power supply. The shorter design allows for
          more space within the lighting and power cabinet for other crucial components,
          reduces the weight and cost, and increases the life of the system. The new
          iTS provides the industry''s first solution for switching or sharing a single
          power source between two different rooms. This reduces installation costs
          by cutting the number of iHP power supplies needed in half and it substantially
          reduces ongoing utility costs.'

          operating income at our DTC businesses improving by approximately $300mm
