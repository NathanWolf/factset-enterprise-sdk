    Gain access to 20+ years of comprehensive estimates and statistics of over 250+ estimated metrics, including financial statement items, product segments, geosegments, and industry metrics. FactSet's consensus estimates are aggregated from a wide base of over 800+ contributors and cover over 19,000 active companies across 90+ countries. Data returned can be accessed on the data frequencies based on quarterly, fiscal years, and calendar years. FactSet Estimates updates on a real time basis intraday (every 5 minutes). Updating times vary based on earning season vs. non-earning season but the goal is to have the data available to the client within a few hours that FactSet receives updated information. Often times updates times can be much faster as FactSet has always been known as one of the fastest estimate providers in the market.

      description: |
        Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using rolling fiscal dates. <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus thought the "next fiscal year" estimates were through time as you "roll" back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p>
