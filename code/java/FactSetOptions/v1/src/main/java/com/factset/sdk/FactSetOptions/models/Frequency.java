/*
 * FactSet Options API
 * The Option Prices database provides pricing data such as mid bid-ask price, reference data (e.g., strike price), and risk measures (e.g., Greeks and implied volatility). Visit [Options Overview OA Page # 14925](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/14925) for details on database coverage. U.S. exchange-traded option bid and ask quotes are continuously updated throughout the day even when no trades have occurred on the option (zero volume). The end-of-day closing bid and ask quotes are always in line with the underlying closing price.  **Note** * Currently in Beta only **OPRA** exchanges are supported.
