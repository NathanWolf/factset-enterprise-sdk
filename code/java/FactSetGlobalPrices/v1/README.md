### Using a Proxy

To add a HTTP proxy for the API client, use `ClientConfig`:
```java

import org.glassfish.jersey.apache.connector.ApacheConnectorProvider;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientProperties;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.*;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.api.CorporateActionsApi;

...

ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
ClientConfig clientConfig = defaultClient.getClientConfig();
clientConfig.connectorProvider(new ApacheConnectorProvider());
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_URI, "http://proxy_url_here");
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_USERNAME, "proxy_username");
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_PASSWORD, "proxy_password");
defaultClient.setClientConfig(clientConfig);

CorporateActionsApi apiInstance = new CorporateActionsApi(defaultClient);

```
