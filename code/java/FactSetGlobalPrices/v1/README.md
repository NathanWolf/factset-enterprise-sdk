- API version: 1.0.1

The FactSet Global Prices API provides end of day market pricing content using cloud and microservices technology, encompassing both pricing as well as corporate actions and events data.</p>



*Automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech)*

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven (3.8.3+)/Gradle (7.2+)

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.factset.sdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>factsetglobalprices</artifactId>
  <version>0.9.0</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()     // Needed if the 'factsetglobalprices' jar has been published to maven central.
    mavenLocal()       // Needed if the 'factsetglobalprices' jar has been published to the local maven repo.
  }

  dependencies {
     implementation "com.factset.sdk:factsetglobalprices:0.9.0"
  }
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

- `target/factsetglobalprices-0.9.0.jar`
- `target/lib/*.jar`

## Usage

To add a HTTP proxy for the API client, use `ClientConfig`:
```java

import org.glassfish.jersey.apache.connector.ApacheConnectorProvider;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig;
import org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientProperties;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.*;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.api.CorporateActionsApi;

...

ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
ClientConfig clientConfig = defaultClient.getClientConfig();
clientConfig.connectorProvider(new ApacheConnectorProvider());
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_URI, "http://proxy_url_here");
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_USERNAME, "proxy_username");
clientConfig.property(ClientProperties.PROXY_PASSWORD, "proxy_password");
defaultClient.setClientConfig(clientConfig);

CorporateActionsApi apiInstance = new CorporateActionsApi(defaultClient);

```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.*;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.auth.*;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.models.*;
import com.factset.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.api.CorporateActionsApi;

public class CorporateActionsApiExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
        defaultClient.setBasePath("https://api.factset.com/content");
        
        // Configure HTTP basic authorization: FactSetApiKey
        HttpBasicAuth FactSetApiKey = (HttpBasicAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("FactSetApiKey");
        FactSetApiKey.setUsername("YOUR USERNAME");
        FactSetApiKey.setPassword("YOUR PASSWORD");

        // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: FactSetOAuth2
        OAuth FactSetOAuth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("FactSetOAuth2");
        FactSetOAuth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");

        CorporateActionsApi apiInstance = new CorporateActionsApi(defaultClient);
