        Get the Fund Level or Share Class Level Assets Under Management (AUM). <p>NOTE - AUM can be accessed on a five-day calendar. If a vendor does not provide NAV and shares outstanding on a market holiday, the previous trading day value is used. If a vendor does provide data on a market holiday, that value will be presented, and then fund flows and AUM will be calculated. When you are manually calculating actual AUM on a market holiday or a rolled date, it will differ from the value shown in the FactSet workstation. This is due to the previous day's NAV being used in the manual AUM calculation.</p>

      summary: Get Fund Flows for a requested date range and list of ids

    post:
      description: "Get the Fund Flows. One-day fund flows are calculated by subtracting\
        \ the shares outstanding at previous close from the shares outstanding one\
        \ day prior to close, and then multiplying the result by the net asset value\
        \ (NAV) of one day prior to close.\n\nThe fund flows calculation breaks down\
        \ as follows - \n(Shares Outstanding T0 - Shares Outstanding T-1) * NAV T-1\n\
        While NAVs are routinely reported on a trade-day (T0) basis, industry-wide\
        \ shares outstanding are a mixture of trade-day and next-day values. Trade-day\
        \ values are not verified, as the actual creation/redemption activity takes\
        \ place late in the evening, after NAVs and shares outstanding values have\
        \ been published. The result is that multiple industry flows are calculated\
        \ using unverified T0 values.\nFactSet has standardized all shares outstanding\
        \ reporting on a next-day basis. To ensure that assets under management (AUM)\
        \ and fund flows are synchronized, FactSet synchronizes shares outstanding\
        \ values and changes with NAVs reported on the previous day, as the creations\
        \ and redemptions used the previous day's reported NAVs as a transaction price.\

            (the Fund) is to seek capital appreciation and, secondarily, income by
            investing in securities, primarily equity securities, that management
            of the Fund believes are undervalued and therefore represent basic investment
            value.

          type: Mutual Fund
          leverageFactor: 0
          objective: The Fund invests primarily in equity securities that Fund management
            believes are undervalued, which means that their prices are less than
            Fund management believes they are worth. Equity securities primarily consist
            of common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock,
            or securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value
            of common stock. Fund management places particular emphasis on companies
            with below average price/earnings ratios that may pay above average dividends.
            The Fund invests primarily in common stock of U.S. companies, but the
            Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the securities of foreign
            companies. The Fund focuses primarily on companies with market capitalizations
            of over $5 billion.

            of the Fund believes are undervalued and therefore represent basic investment

            believes are undervalued, which means that their prices are less than
            Fund management believes they are worth. Equity securities primarily consist
            of common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock,
            or securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value
            of common stock. Fund management places particular emphasis on companies
            with below average price/earnings ratios that may pay above average dividends.
            The Fund invests primarily in common stock of U.S. companies, but the
            Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the securities of foreign
            companies. The Fund focuses primarily on companies with market capitalizations
            of over $5 billion.
