   * @param currency Currency code for adjusting prices. Default is Local. For a list of currency ISO codes, visit [Online Assistant Page 1470](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/1470). (optional)
   * @param adjust Controls the split, spinoff, and dividend adjustments for the prices. &lt;p&gt;For more information, visit [Online Assistant Page 614](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/614)&lt;/p&gt;   * **SPLIT** &#x3D; Split ONLY Adjusted. This is used by default.   * **SPINOFF** &#x3D; Splits &amp; Spinoff Adjusted.   * **DIVADJ** &#x3D; Splits, Spinoffs, and Dividends adjusted.   * **UNSPLIT** &#x3D; No Adjustments.  (optional, default to SPLIT)
   * @param batch Enables the ability to asynchronously \&quot;batch\&quot; the request, supporting a long-running request up to **10 minutes**. Upon requesting batch&#x3D;Y, the service will respond back with an HTTP Status Code of 202.  **&#x60;batch&#x60; is currently in **BETA**. Additional Access Required. To gain access to this feature, reach out to your FactSet Account team or \&quot;Report Issue\&quot; above and our support teams can assist.**  Once a batch request is submitted, use &#x60;batch/v1/status&#x60; to see if the job has completed. Once completed, retrieve the results of the request via &#x60;batch/v1/result&#x60;. See [Batching API](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/factset-content-api-batch) for more details.  When using Batch, &#x60;ids&#x60; limit is increased to **5000** ids per request, though limits on query string via GET method still apply. It&#39;s advised to submit large lists of ids via POST method.  (optional, default to N)
