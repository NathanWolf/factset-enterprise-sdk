Since a fiscal year and a calendar year do not necessarily match with regard to their start and end dates, the year is derived as the calendar year occupied to a larger extent by the fiscal year, using a June through May fiscal year assignment. That means, fiscal years ending from the 1st of June onwards are assigned to the same calendar year. Either must be at most two years in the future.
