/*
 * Recommendation List API For Digital Portals
 * A recommendation list is revision-controlled, with up to 5,000 revisions per recommendation list.  A recommendation list as of a given revision may optionally point to an instrument (e.g. an index) and contains a list of up to 1,000 elements, each referring to a security traded on a market (e.g. a financial product recommended by the bank). For listings that are not available in the Wealth Management platform, no information beyond a customer-defined name is available. Each element may optionally have a portfolio weight. Identifiers for revisions are globally unique.  See the Quotes API for Digital Portals for access to detailed price information.
