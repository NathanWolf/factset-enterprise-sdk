# InlineResponse20022Data

Fund flows (i.e., the amount invested or divested from a fund) based on the creation/redemption process. The data returned may not be related to overall volume or price movement. All fund flow inputs use transaction-day values to ensure that all assets under management (AUM) and flows are fully comparable and reflective of the same, verified market conditions. This data is available for all the regions.
