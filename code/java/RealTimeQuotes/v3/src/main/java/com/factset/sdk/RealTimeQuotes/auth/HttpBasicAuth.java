Market coverage is included in the *Sample Use Cases* section below.  The Digital Portal use case is focused on high-performance applications that are  * serving millions of end-users, * accessible by client browsers via the internet, * supporting subscriptions for streamed updates out-of-the-box, * typically combining a wide variety of *for Digital Portals*-APIs into a highly use-case specific solution for customers, * integrated into complex infrastructures such as existing frontend frameworks, authentication services.  All APIs labelled *for Digital Portals* have been designed for direct use by client web applications and feature extreme low latency: The average response time across all endpoints is 30 ms whereas 99% of all requests are answered in close to under 300ms.
