## Notes for Large OpenAPI documents
If the OpenAPI document is large, imports in fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.apis and fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.models may fail with a
RecursionError indicating the maximum recursion limit has been exceeded. In that case, there are a couple of solutions:

Solution 1:
Use specific imports for apis and models like:
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.api.default_api import DefaultApi`
- `from fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.model.pet import Pet`

Solution 2:
Before importing the package, adjust the maximum recursion limit as shown below:
```
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
import fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices
from fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.apis import *
from fds.sdk.FactSetGlobalPrices.models import *
```
