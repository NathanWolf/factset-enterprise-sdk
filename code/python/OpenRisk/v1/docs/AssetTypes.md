# AssetTypes

**(since 1.4.0)** A mapping of security ID to its asset type as the standard asset type keys. When this input is in a request, it is used to (1) identify assets that use Underlying IDs from 'underlyingIds' input, and (2) identify asset types compatible with automatic removal of their contribution of currency to risk unless any form of the 'removeCurrencyRisk' input is also provided. When this input is used in the request, underlying IDs (provided via 'underlyingIds' input) are only respected for the following standard asset type keys (all other underlying IDs will be discarded): refer to [OA:22019](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/22019) for compatible asset type keys and more details.
