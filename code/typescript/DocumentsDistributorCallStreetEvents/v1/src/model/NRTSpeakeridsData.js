/**
 * Documents Distributor - CallStreet Events
 * CallStreet Events contains all the Documents Distributor APIs that provide events data such as Events Audio and Near Real-Time Transcripts  The  Events Audio API provides access to all audio recordings to various company events covered by FactSet. The events include, but are not limited to: earnings calls, conferences, and investor days.   This API also provides relevant metadata such as timestamps and identifiers around each audio file.  The Documents Distributor - Near Real-time Transcripts API enables access to Near Real-time Transcripts provided by CallStreet to time-sensitive clients. This API also provides the relevant speaker metadata along with their confidence scores. This data caters to quant clients interested in building machine learning models.  Clients can leverage this API to perform sentiment analysis through natural language processing or machine learning. It can also be used to complement analysis using FactSet's transcripts service.
