factsetrbics - JavaScript client for @factset/sdk-factsetrbics
FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) is a comprehensive structured taxonomy to classify companies by what they primarily do. It delivers a granular view for investors by classifying companies using a bottom-up approach according to the products and services they provide. By combining this approach with a top-level grouping based on companies' behavior similarities and stock co-movement, FactSet RBICS delivers unprecedented precision for 1,400+ sector groups.

RBICS Focus is a six level classification which highlights the companys main business. It is based on the company business line/s that stand for majority of a the revenue that the company generates. Updated monthly. For more details, visit [Online Assitant Page #20710](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/20710).

## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install @factset/sdk-factsetrbics --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your @factset/sdk-factsetrbics from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g. <https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID>
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
const { ApiClient, EntityFocusApi } = require('@factset/sdk-factsetrbics');
const { ConfidentialClient } = require('@factset/sdk-utils');

const apiClient = ApiClient.instance;

// Configure HTTP basic authorization: FactSetApiKey
const FactSetApiKey = apiClient.authentications['FactSetApiKey'];
FactSetApiKey.username = 'YOUR USERNAME';
FactSetApiKey.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD';

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: FactSetOAuth2
const FactSetOAuth2 = apiClient.authentications['FactSetOAuth2'];
FactSetOAuth2.accessToken = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN';

// Configure OAuth2 access with ConfidentialClient
apiClient.factsetOauth2Client = new ConfidentialClient('./config.json');

const apiInstance = new EntityFocusApi();
const ids = ["AAPL-US","0FPWZZ-E","TSLA-US"]; // [String] | List of Company identifiers. Accepted identifiers include Ticker-Exchange, Ticker-Regions, CUSIPs, ISINs, SEDOLs, or FactSet Permanent Ids, such as -R, -L, or -E.<p>**ids limit = 2500 per request**</p>    Make note, GET Method URL request lines are also limited to a total length of 8192 bytes (8KB). In cases where the service allows for thousands of ids, which may lead to exceeding this request line limit of 8KB, its advised for any requests with large request lines to be requested through the respective \"POST\" method.</p> 
const opts = {
  'date': 2017-07-24, // String | Effective date for data expressed in YYYY-MM-DD format. If no date is requested, the default behavior is to return the full history for the requested entity.
  'levels': [1,3,6], // [Number] | List of RBICS industry levels to include in the response. **By default if left blank, all levels are returned.**
  'includeNames': true // Boolean | Option to include or exclude industry Names and the L6 Description. true = Include Names; false = Exclude Names.
};

// Call api endpoint
apiInstance.getRbicsEntityFocus(ids, opts).then(
  data => {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data:');
    console.log(data);
  },
  error => {
    console.error(error);
  },
);

```
